# Battleship

This is the main group project for a C++ software course (software design and project management based) I completed in 2021. For this project, I worked as the software architect, designing the architecture without a framework for the first time (this was also the first large C/C++ project I was part of). In terms of content, I mainly worked on the back-end (ships, board, etc) and ensured quality, while other entities and front-end work like sprites and screens were created by other team members.

While this project overall is pretty simple & straightforward, my team did this mainly to learn more about C++, which we definitely succeeded in. In a few months, I learned a lot of concepts, including properly using pointers, CMAKE, refactoring & software design, and everyone's favorite: fixing plenty of git merge conflicts ðŸ™ƒ
